## Abstract  
In Singapore, the tropical location has
led to the flourishing of a diverse variety of unique
flora and fauna. With the increase in hobbyists as
well as professional botanists, automatic
identification of plant species has proven to be a
useful tool to help bridge the botanical taxonomic
divide. Plant recognition systems that currently
exist cater to a global perspective and perform
poorly on plant species native to Singapore. These
systems also perform identification using preexisting manually labelled plant databases and
perform poorly on plants in real-world conditions.
Furthermore, these systems are limited in their
features and lack user interactivity aspects. Thus,
in this research, the focus is on creating a highly
accurate and robust Image classification model
capable of identifying various plant species using
Machine Learning techniques. This is then
implemented as a feature in an interactive, mobile
application. The mobile application also provides
other features such as information on the identified
plant and information on nearest nature parks
using the NParks dataset. Thus, this mobile
application provides a rapid, accurate and precise
tool for the identification of Singapore's rich plant
life, that can be used easily for a wide range of
audience.
